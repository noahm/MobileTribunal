Mobile Tribunal
===============

Mobile Tribunal was an unofficial proxy interface to Riot's tribunal for League of Legends. The tribunal has been discontinued, and this project is now defunct.

The tribunal used to allow any player of the game to earn small amounts of in-game currency by reviewing cases of reported players. Users could vote to pardon or punish based on included chat logs and other game data. This proxy project presented all the same information in a mobile-friendly format which was much more usable than Riot's official site was at the time. It used to look like this:

Features
--------

* Web interface designed for both small phone screens and tablets. Works just fine on the desktop too!
* Tested on Mobile Safari, Android, Mobile IE (Windows Phone), and more!
* Chat filters let you easily follow conversations and quickly check the reported player's language
* More intuitive information layout than the official Tribunal
* The easiest way to earn IP while you poop!

Notes
-----

* Opera Mini doesn't have complete support for javascript and won't work. Use Opera Mobile if your device supports it.

Running MobTrib for yourself
----------------------------

If you don't trust using the app on our host, that's just fine. You can easily run it yourself on any
web server equiped with PHP 5, but we worked with Apache. [More details available on our Wiki](https://github.com/noahm/MobileTribunal/wiki/Hosting-MobTrib-Yourself)

Reporting Issues
----------------

We use the issue tracker here on github and through the reddit community
of [/r/mobiletribunal](http://www.reddit.com/r/mobiletribunal). Please report
bugs in either of the two places.

As this product depends on Riot's servers to deliver the game information,
in some cases there is only so much we can do. With that said, we want to make
this a high quality product and will try to continue improving it over time.
